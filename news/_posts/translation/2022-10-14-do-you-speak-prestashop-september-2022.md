Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in September!

## Project news

### ‚ûï PrestaShop 8 strings are ready for translation

PrestaShop 8 is just around the corner! The new strings are still available for translation. You are more than welcome to help contribute to the project and bring PrestaShop 8 to the world!

Though the wording is always reviewed when a pull request is submitted, some mistakes could have been missed. So, let us know if you notice something wrong so that we can fix it. 	
Since PrestaShop 8 hasn‚Äôt been released yet and contains a lot of new features, you may be lacking context or stumbling upon unclear strings. Of course, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help! You can open an issue in the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù section of a string and I will do my best to answer your questions. In any case, don‚Äôt forget that you will still be able to modify the translations when the new version is released.


### üáøüá¶Afrikaans has been added to the translation project!

A new language has been added to the PrestaShop translation project: Afrikaans! We would like to thank Carolien Gibb (gibbgraphix) for her suggestion üéâ 


### üîß The translation push issue has been resolved!
The previous issue regarding translation updates has been fixed. This means that translation updates in the PrestaShop back office are now fully functional! Thanks for your patience. üôå

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
