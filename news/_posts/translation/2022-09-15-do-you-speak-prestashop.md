Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in August!

## Project news

### ‚ûï PrestaShop 8 is ready for translation

PrestaShop 8 is on its way! While it brings new features, this new version also means new strings. A file containing all PrestaShop 8 strings has been pushed to Crowdin, and is ready for translation!

Even though the wording is always reviewed when a pull request is submitted, some mistakes could have been missed. So, don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know if you notice something wrong so that we can correct it. Note that, despite the string freeze, we will wait a few weeks before adding the corrections to Crowdin. After that, we won‚Äôt be able to add any new wordings. 
And as version 8 has not been released yet, some strings may appear a bit unclear because of the lack of context. In this case, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help! You can open an issue in the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù section of a string and I will do my best to answer your questions. In any case, don‚Äôt forget that you will still be able to modify the translations when the new version is released.


### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNew translation project manager

Hello, I‚Äôm L√©a, the new Content Manager for PrestaShop. I joined on September 12th and I‚Äôm happy to be a part of this project. Looking forward to working with you all! 

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [Andr√© Gomes](https://crowdin.com/profile/croquete1) and [Diesserr](https://crowdin.com/profile/diesserr) who rushed into the efforts immediately! 

### üõ†Ô∏è Working on resolving some issues

You may have noticed that translation updates are currently not available in PrestaShop back office. Our team is working on resolving the issue, we will keep you posted on the situation!

## A few stats
 
* **55 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **57,817 words have been translated** and **44,940 validated**.
* All this in **30 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
